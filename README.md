# Ultimate Pig

## Solitaire Dice Game

 The purpose of this excercise is to create a simulation of different types of players of Pig Solitaire. You should have a base Player class that only rolls once per turn. Then create Player subclasses -- at least 2 -- that have different strategies. Create charts showing how they do in a large number of trials. Attempt to create an optimal player and back up your assertion with charts and data.
